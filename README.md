### File Monitoring system

The goal of this task is to design and develop a file monitoring system.
Generate a random writer that writes pseudo strings (with at least 50% probability of generating the “MARUTI” keyword. Note that we are strictly looking at the "MARUTI" keyword only as a single value not the MARUTI keyword inside a random string) into two separate files at regular interval of time.

It should have the capability to monitor both the files and count the total number of occurrences for the “MARUTI” keyword by each file and write output to the "counts.log" file.
